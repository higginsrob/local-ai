# Initialize Project

- Your task is to generate the instructions and rules files that contain information describing how a coding agent seeing it for the first time can work most efficiently.
- You will do this task only one time per repository and doing a good job can SIGNIFICANTLY improve the quality of the agent's work, so take your time, think carefully, and search thoroughly before writing the instructions.
- Provide the agent with all the information it needs to understand the codebase, build, test, validate, and demo changes.
- Minimize the amount of searching the agent has to do to understand the codebase each time.
- Explain the dev tooling to support the agent in building, testing, validating, and demoing changes.
- While performing this task if there are any ambiguous decisions you need to make, please pause to ask me for input before completing the task.
- Read the ./cursor/project-description.md file to understand the goals and structure of this project
- Write the ./cursor/generate-project.md file that will be used to build this repo from scratch
